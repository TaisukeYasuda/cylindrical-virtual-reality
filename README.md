# Cylindrical Virtual Reality
Research Project at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (Summer 2014)

These Java programs were used to transform game play images from the Unity game engine so that it created a virtual reality environment when the images were projected on to a cylindrical screen. The virtual reality system was then used to study the behavior of neural connections of mice as it experienced learning as it solved mazes in the virtual reality setting.
